# TSD

- [Original Repo](https://github.com/SamVerschueren/tsd)
- [Forked Repo](https://github.com/MLH-Fellowship/tsd/)

## Things worked on

- [[Passing-custom-types]] Allows you to specify type files and test files manually instead of depending on TSD to do those automatically.
- [[Report-tests-count]] Reports the number of tests ran. Merging this makes tsd return `numTests` which will be the total number of tests ran.
